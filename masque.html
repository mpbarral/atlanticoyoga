        <h3>More than just a physical practice...<br /><br /></h3>
        <p>"If you really want Yoga to feel good, you got to care about other beings...<br />
          our body embodies all these beings and in order to make yourself happy, you need to make them happy." <br /><a href="http://www.richardfreemanyoga.com/"> -  Richard Freeman</a></p>

        <p>	 <br /> <br />"What lies behind us and what lies ahead of us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us..."<br />
          - Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>

        <p>	 <br /> <br />“Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; <br />
          enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it won’t).” <br />
          – James Baraz”</p>


        <p>     <br /> <br />"Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment." – Gautama Buddha”</p>
